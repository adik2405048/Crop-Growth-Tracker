# Crop-Growth-Tracker
Crop Growth Tracker built entirely from the ground up in C++
As a Agricultural Engineering student passionate about creating efficient and high-performance solutions, I challenged myself to build this practical tool for agriculture using C++. The goal was to create a fast, lightweight, and reliable console application that helps farmers and agriculture students track and forecast crop development. This application is a pure C++ console program. I focused on clean code architecture, object-oriented principles (where applicable) and efficient data handling using standard C++ libraries like <iostream>, <vector>, <map>, and especially <chrono> for precise date and time calculations.

Key Features:
• Multiple Crop Selection: Users can choose from a variety of major crops like Paddy, Wheat, Jute, and more.
• Sowing Date Input: Simply enter the date a crop was sown to start tracking.
• Real-Time Stage Calculation: The application instantly calculates and displays the current growth stage based on the days passed.
• Progress Visualization: A text-based progress bar provides an at-a-glance view of the crop's journey to maturity.
• Lightweight & Fast: Being a native C++ application, it's incredibly fast and runs with minimal system resources on any terminal.

This tool empowers farmers with data-driven insights for better planning. By knowing the precise growth stage of their crops, they can make timely decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, ultimately leading to better yields and more efficient resource management. This project was an excellent exercise in strengthening my C++ skills and applying them to a practical, real-world scenario. I'm always looking for feedback and new ideas!
